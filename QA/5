Assume the class consists of three 8-bit data members a, b, 
and c. Create a Custom Constructor that allows the user to 
update the value of these data members while adding a constructor 
to the class. Test your code by adding the value of 2, 4, and 56 to a, b and c
respectively. Share your SV Code.



class ex1;
int unsigned a,b,c;
function new(input int unsigned g,d,k);
this.a=g;
this.b=d;
this.c=k;
endfunction 
endclass


module P1( );
initial begin
ex1 f1;
f1=new(1,2,3);
$display("%0d,%0d,%0d",f1.a,f1.b,f1.c); 
end
endmodule
